    Raid 2 is a really good action movie that I watched recently. It is a sequel to the original Raid movie and continues the story of the main character.

<h3> Jigra </h3>
<p>
    Jigra is a movie based on the relationship of a brother and sister, where brother gets caught because of his cousin's mistake
    and the sister tries to save him. The movie is really good and I would recommend it to everyone.
